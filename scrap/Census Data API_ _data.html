<td>1986 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1986</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1986/cbp</a></td>

<td>1990 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1990</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1990/cbp</a></td>

They differ from the postcensal estimates that are released annually because they rely on a formula that redistributes the difference between the April 1 postcensal estimate and April 1 census count for the end of the decade across the estimates for that decade. Meanwhile, the postcensal estimates incorporate current data on births, deaths, and migration to produce each new vintage of estimates, and to revise estimates for years back to the last census.

This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>1994 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 1994 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1994</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1994/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1995</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1995/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1996</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1996/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1997</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1997/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1998</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 1998 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1998</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1998/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>1998 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>1998</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/1998/nonemp</a></td>

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>1999</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 1999 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>1999</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/1999/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>1999 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>1999</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/1999/nonemp</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2000 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2000</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2000/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw districts for the United States Congress and state legislature. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks. State participation in defining areas is voluntary and nonpartisan.</td><td>2000</td><td>dec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>pl</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl">http://api.census.gov/data/2000/dec/pl</a></td>

Summary File 3 consists of 813 detailed tables of Census 2000 social, economic and housing characteristics compiled from a sample of approximately 19 million housing units (about 1 in 6 households) that received the Census 2000 long-form questionnaire. Fifty-one tables are repeated for nine major race and Hispanic or Latino groups: White alone; Black or African American alone; American Indian and Alaska Native alone; Asian alone; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone; Some other race alone; Two or more races; Hispanic or Latino; and White alone, not Hispanic or Latino.

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level.

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2001</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2001/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2001 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2001</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2001/nonemp</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>2003</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 2003 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2003</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2003/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2003 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2003</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2003/nonemp</a></td>

The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status).Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2004 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2004</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2004/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2004 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2004</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2004/nonemp</a></td>

<td>2005 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2005</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2005/nonemp</a></td>

<td>2006 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.  The Census Bureau plans to release revised statistics at a later date.</td><td>2006</td><td>cbp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cbp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cbp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cbp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cbp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cbp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cbp">http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cbp</a></td>

<td>Mar 2006 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2006</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2006/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2006</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2006/nonemp</a></td>

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2007</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2007/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>2007 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2007</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2007/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2007/nonemp</a></td>

<td>2008 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2008</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2008/nonemp</a></td>

Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>2009 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2009</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2009/nonemp</a></td>

<td>ACS 1-Year Detailed Tables</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The 2012 data provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. Data are available at the state and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition Puerto Rico into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each. The Puerto Rico PUMS file for an individual year, such as 2019, contain data on approximately one percent of the Puerto Rico population.</td><td>2010</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>acs5<span class="hier-sep">› </span>pumspr</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/pumspr/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/pumspr/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/pumspr/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/pumspr/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/pumspr/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/pumspr">http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/pumspr</a></td>

<td>2006-2010 American Community Survey: Migration Flows</td><td>Migration flows are derived from the relationship between the location of current residence in the American Community Survey (ACS) sample and the responses given to the migration question "Where did you live 1 year ago?".  There are flow statistics (moved in, moved out, and net moved) between county or minor civil division (MCD) of residence and county, MCD, or world region of residence 1 year ago.  Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places.  Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset.   Flow statistics are available by three or four variables for each dataset starting with the 2006-2010 5-year ACS datasets.  The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets.  In addition to the flow estimates, there are supplemental statistics files that contain migration/geographical mobility estimates (e.g., nonmovers, moved to a different state, moved from abroad) for each county, MCD, or metro area.</td><td>2010</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>flows</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/flows/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/flows/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/flows/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/flows/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/flows/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/flows">http://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/flows</a></td>

<td>2010 County Business Patterns: Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides economic data by industry at the U.S., State, County and Metropolitan Area levels. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. CBP provides statistics for businesses with paid employees for the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). As a result, we suppressed 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors. While suppressed values can be derived by subtraction, we do not recommend using the derived values in any analyses.

<td>Mar 2010 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2010</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2010/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>Decennial Census: American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File</td><td>The AIAN Summary File contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder.  The American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) contains data on population characteristics, such as sex, age, average household size, household type, and relationship to householder. The file also includes housing characteristics, such as tenure (whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter- occupied) and age of householder for occupied housing units. Selected aggregates and medians also are provided. A complete listing of subjects in the AIANSF is found in Chapter 3, Subject Locator. The layout of the tables in the AIANSF is similar to that in Summary File 2 (SF 2). These data are presented in 47 population tables (identified with a "PCT") and 14 housing tables (identified with an "HCT") shown down to the census tract level; and 10 population tables (identified with a "PCO") shown down to the county level, for a total of 71 tables. 

Each table is iterated for the total population, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone, the total American Indian and Alaska Native population alone or in combination, and 1,567 detailed tribes and tribal groupings. Tribes or tribal groupings are included on the iterations list if they met a threshold of at least 100 people in the 2010 Census. In addition, the presentation of AIANSF tables for any of the tribes and tribal groupings is subject to a population threshold of 100 or more people in a given geography. That is, if there are fewer than 100 people in a specific population group in a specific geographic area, their population and housing characteristics data are not available for that geographic area in the AIANSF.

It specifies that within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the governor and legislative leadership in each state the data they need to redraw congressional and state legislative districts. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords the states an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks. State participation in defining areas is voluntary and nonpartisan.</td><td>2010</td><td>dec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>pl</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl">http://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/pl</a></td>

The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns.

<td>2011 Nonemployer Statistics: Non Employer Statistics</td><td>Nonemployer Statistics is an annual series that provides subnational economic data for businesses that have no paid employees and are subject to federal income tax. The data consist of the number of businesses and total receipts by industry. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals operating unincorporated businesses (known as sole proprietorships), which may or may not be the owner's principal source of income.
The majority of all business establishments in the United States are nonemployers, yet these firms average less than 4 percent of all sales and receipts nationally. Due to their small economic impact, these firms are excluded from most other Census Bureau business statistics (the primary exception being the Survey of Business Owners). The Nonemployers Statistics series is the primary resource available to study the scope and activities of nonemployers at a detailed geographic level. For complementary statistics on the firms that do have paid employees, refer to the County Business Patterns. Additional sources of data on small businesses include the Economic Census, and the Statistics of U.S. Businesses.</td><td>2011</td><td>nonemp</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp">http://api.census.gov/data/2011/nonemp</a></td>

In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels.

<td>2008-2012 American Community Survey: Migration Flows</td><td>Migration flows are derived from the relationship between the location of current residence in the American Community Survey (ACS) sample and the responses given to the migration question "Where did you live 1 year ago?".  There are flow statistics (moved in, moved out, and net moved) between county or minor civil division (MCD) of residence and county, MCD, or world region of residence 1 year ago.  Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places.  Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset.   Flow statistics are available by three or four variables for each dataset starting with the 2006-2010 5-year ACS datasets.  The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets.  In addition to the flow estimates, there are supplemental statistics files that contain migration/geographical mobility estimates (e.g., nonmovers, moved to a different state, moved from abroad) for each county, MCD, or metro area.</td><td>2012</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>flows</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/flows/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/flows/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/flows/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/flows/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/flows/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="http://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/flows">http://api.census.gov/data/2012/acs/flows</a></td>

The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

NOTE: 
Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. 

The projections generally do not precisely agree with population estimates available elsewhere on the Census Bureau website for methodological reasons.

The U.S. Census Bureau periodically produces projections of the United States resident population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Population projections are estimates of the population for future dates. They are typically based on an estimated population consistent with the most recent decennial census and are produced using the cohort-component method. Projections illustrate possible courses of population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, net international migration, and domestic migration. In some cases, several series of projections are produced based on alternative assumptions for future fertility, life expectancy, net international migration, and (for state-level projections) state-to-state or domestic migration.

Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places.  Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset.   Flow statistics are available by three or four variables for each dataset starting with the 2006-2010 5-year ACS datasets.  The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets.

Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2013</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2013/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>Mar 2014 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2014</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2014/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2014/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2015</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acsse</a></td>

<td>Mar 2015 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

<td>ACS 1-Year Data Profiles</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2016</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>acs1<span class="hier-sep">› </span>profile</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile">http://api.census.gov/data/2016/acs/acs1/profile</a></td>

<td>Mar 2016 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2016</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2016/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2016/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

The Census Bureau provides flow statistics (moved in, moved out, and net moved) between county or minor civil division (MCD) of residence and county, MCD, or world region of residence 1 year ago. Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset. In addition to the flow estimates, there are supplemental statistics files that contain migration/geographical mobility estimates (e.g., nonmovers, moved to a different state, moved from abroad) for each county, MCD, or metro area.</td><td>2017</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>flows</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/flows/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/flows/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/flows/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/flows/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/flows/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/flows">http://api.census.gov/data/2017/acs/flows</a></td>

<td>Annual Economic Surveys: Business Patterns: County Business Patterns</td><td>County Business Patterns (CBP) is an annual series that provides sub-national economic data by industry. This series includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, first quarter payroll, and annual payroll. This data is useful for studying the economic activity of small areas, analyzing economic changes over time, and as a benchmark for other statistical series, surveys, and databases between economic censuses. Businesses use the data for analyzing market potential, measuring the effectiveness of sales and advertising programs, setting sales quotas, and developing budgets.

<td>Mar 2017 Current Population Survey: Annual Social and Economic (March) Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2017</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2017/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

<td>ACS 1-Year Profile Tables</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

<td>ACS 1-Year Supplemental Estimates</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2018</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>acsse</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse">http://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acsse</a></td>

Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places. Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset. Flow statistics are available by three or four variables for each dataset starting with the 2006-2010 5-year ACS datasets. The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets.

<td>American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Data Profiles 1-Year</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a uswide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the us, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.</td><td>2019</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>acs1<span class="hier-sep">› </span>profile</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile">http://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs1/profile</a></td>

The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. It produces estimates for small areas, including census tracts and population subgroups. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

<td>2020 American Community Survey: 5-Year Estimates - Public Use Microdata Sample</td><td>The American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) contains a sample of responses to the ACS. The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each.

<td>2016-2020 American Community Survey: Migration Flows</td><td>Migration flows are derived from the relationship between the location of current residence in the American Community Survey (ACS) sample and the responses given to the migration question "Where did you live 1 year ago?". There are flow statistics (moved in, moved out, and net moved) between county or minor civil division (MCD) of residence and county, MCD, or world region of residence 1 year ago. Estimates for MCDs are only available for the 12 strong-MCD states, where the MCDs have the same government functions as incorporated places. Migration flows between metropolitan statistical areas are available starting with the 2009-2013 5-year ACS dataset. Flow statistics are available by three or four variables for each dataset starting with the 2006-2010 5-year ACS datasets. The variables change for each dataset and do not repeat in overlapping datasets. In addition to the flow estimates, there are supplemental statistics files that contain migration/geographical mobility estimates (e.g. nonmovers, moved to a different state, moved from abroad) for each county, MCD, or metro area.</td><td>2020</td><td>acs<span class="hier-sep">› </span>flows</td><td>Aggregate</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/flows/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/flows/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/flows/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/flows/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/flows/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/flows">http://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/flows</a></td>

The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2020</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2020/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2020/cps/asec/mar</a></td>

To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a program that affords state officials an opportunity before each decennial census to define the small areas for which they wish to receive census population totals for redistricting purposes. Officials may receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards) and state house and senate districts, in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and tabulation blocks.

The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year.

The estimates are developed from an April 1, 2020 base population and may incorporate changes resulting from the Count Question Resolution program and/or geographic program revisions. 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races. The sum of the five race-in-combination groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of 'Some Other Race' from the Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown in this file versus those in the Census data. // Current data on births, deaths, and migration are used to calculate population change since April 1, 2020.

<td>Current Population Survey&nbsp;Annual Social and Economic&nbsp;Supplement</td><td>The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. 
 
The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections.  

To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</td><td>2022</td><td>cps<span class="hier-sep">› </span>asec<span class="hier-sep">› </span>mar</td><td>Microdata</td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/cps/asec/mar/geography.html">geographies</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/cps/asec/mar/variables.html">variables</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/cps/asec/mar/groups.html">groups</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/cps/asec/mar/sorts.html">sorts</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/cps/asec/mar/examples.html">examples</a></td><td><a href="https://www.census.gov/developer/">documentation</a></td><td><a href="http://api.census.gov/data/2022/cps/asec/mar">http://api.census.gov/data/2022/cps/asec/mar</a></td>
